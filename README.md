My Engineering 4 work

## Pi Online
In this assignment I was tasked with connecting my raspberry pi to the internet. My pi wouldn't connect to the wifi at my house but I did manage to connect it to my personal hotspot. I had to take the space out of the name of my phone and it took a few tries before it actually connected. I couldn't find any reason for it to not be connecting so I just kept trying and eventually it connected.
